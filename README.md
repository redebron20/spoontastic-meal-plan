# Spoontastic::Meal::Plan

This CLI application allows the user to search for meal plans based on diets and intolerances. The user can view the recipe details with ingredients, instructions, servings, and cooking time. The application will let the user save any and even multiple recipes' ingredients with desired number of servings to the shopping list. Then the user can retrieve the full shopping list when done.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spoontastic-meal-plan'

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install spoontastic-meal-plan
